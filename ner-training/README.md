# FALP-NER
Repository containing the source code for the NER experiments performed in the paper: Automatic support system for tumor coding in pathology reports in Spanish.

First, download the [FALP corpus](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5555431) and save it into the `falp` folder. Then, download the [Spanish clinical embeddings](https://zenodo.org/record/3924799) and save them into the `embeddings` folder. Finally, execute the `src/main.py` script to train the NER model.
